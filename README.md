This repository demonstrates a common error in unsafe Rust code: manipulating vector data via a raw pointer after potential reallocation.  The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.rs` shows a safe alternative using vector indexing or methods.  Always prioritize safe Rust practices whenever possible, resorting to unsafe code only when absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
